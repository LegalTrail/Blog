### When Trust Turns to Tragedy: Sanket's Quest to Expose the Fraud

Sanket a 19-year-old boy who moved to a well-known city for his graduation. Being a passionate cricket player, he joined an application to participate in tournaments. On this platform, he encountered an unfortunate incident.

Sanket eagerly registered for a tournament and paid a registration fee of Rs. 1500 to a person he met on the app. However, after the payment, the person vanished, ignoring the Sanket's messages. Only a few brief messages were sent, pleading for the money to be returned out of respect for hard-earned parental income.

On the next day, Sanket received a phone call from an individual claiming to be a police officer from the Gujarat Police. The imposter's WhatsApp profile picture even showed them wearing a police uniform. Shockingly, the imposter informed the Sanket that the person he had dealt with had committed suicide due to Sanket's messages. Exploiting the situation, the imposter demanded Rs. 20,000 from Sanket to settle the matter.

Fearing the repercussions and desperate to protect his reputation and family's honor, Sanket succumbed to the pressure and sent Rs. 16,000 as he had only that amount arranged by the day. The imposter, taking advantage of the Sanket's vulnerability, further coerced him into revealing personal information, including college details and his location.

The next day, the imposter called again, informing Sanket that instead of himself, he had coerced another person to take responsibility for the allegations made against him. Now, he demanded an additional Rs. 25,000, claiming that his senior officer required the money to settle the matter. He threatened the boy with tarnishing his reputation and the possibility of being imprisoned if he refused to comply.

With Sanket's parents growing increasingly concerned, they rushed to the city to support their son. Throughout this distressing ordeal, Sanket continued to negotiate with the imposter, requesting more time to arrange the demanded sum. Eventually, with the arrival of his parents, they decided to take legal action.
Together, they filed a complaint at the local police station, providing all the necessary information, call recordings and evidence of the fraudulent activities. The Maharashtra police and the Cyber branch commenced an investigation into the matter, focusing on identifying the imposter and bringing them to justice. The imposter, if found guilty, would face severe legal consequences.

Under Indian law, the imposter could be charged with several offenses, including:
- Fraud: Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) states that whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.
- Impersonation of a police officer: Section 205 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) states that whoever falsely personates another, and in such assumed character makes any admission or statement, or confesses judgment, or causes any process to be issued or becomes bail or security, or does any other act in any suit or criminal prosecution, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years.
- Unauthorized access to personal information: According to UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India), unauthorized access to the central identities data repository (CIDR) is an offence punishable by imprisonment up to 10 years and a fine of minimum Rs. 10 Lakhs.

By taking legal action, Sanket and his parents aimed to ensure that justice was served and to prevent the imposter from victimizing others. Their determination to expose the truth and protect their reputation showcased the importance of standing up against fraud and seeking the assistance of the appropriate authorities.

I urge every citizen to stay strong and not be afraid in such situations. Reach out to the authorities and don't let fraudsters take advantage of you. Your voice matters, and by seeking help, we can protect ourselves and others from these scams. Stay vigilant and united against fraud.
